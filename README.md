# 🍽️ FODO — Food Donation Platform

FODO is a **full-stack MERN application** designed to connect **food donors** with **NGOs** in order to reduce food waste and streamline the donation process through a centralized digital platform.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Food donation often suffers from:
- Manual coordination via calls and messages
- Lack of real-time visibility on donation status
- Delays in matching donors with NGOs
- Inefficient tracking of requests

FODO addresses these issues by providing a **role-based, real-time web platform** for managing food donations efficiently.

FODO enables:
- Donors to create and track food donation requests
- NGOs to view, accept, and manage available donations
- Real-time status updates without manual follow-ups

The platform is designed to handle **multiple users simultaneously** while maintaining data consistency and low response times.
